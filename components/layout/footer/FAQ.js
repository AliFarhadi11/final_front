                WHY SHOULD I REGISTER AN ACCOUNT?
                <br/>There are areas and functions which are only available for registered Playerscube users, such as:
                <br/> •	Create and write posts in the future
                <br/> •	Send private messages to other registered users in the future
                <br/> •	Set several individual options in the user profile
                <br/>IS THE REGISTRATION ON PLAYERKIT FOR FREE?
                <br/>  •	Yes, the registration is free.
                <br/>CAN I DELETE MY ACCOUNT ANYTIME?
                <br/>  •	Yes, you can. The option to delete your account can be found in the user profile.
                <br/>CAN I CREATE MORE THAN ONE ACCOUNT?
                <br/>  •	No. One account per user. Creating several accounts is not wanted and may result in exclusion.
                <br/>WHY WAS MY REGISTRATION REJECTED?
                <br/>  •	Using incorrect or false information or an inappropriate user name could be reasons for the rejection.
                <br/>WHY CAN’T I LOG IN?
                <br/>   •	Did you register an account? You have to register an account in the first place before you can log in. If you are already registered but still cannot log in please check your user name and your password. All newly created accounts need to be activated by an administrator which could take some time.
                <br/>I FORGOT MY PASSWORD.
                <br/>  •	No worries! You can get a new password. Please click "Forgot password?" below the login button. Follow the instructions and you should then be able to log in again.
                <br/>DOES PLAYERKIT USE COOKIES?
                <br/>   •	Using cookies in this forum is optional. They make the use of the forum easier and more comfortable. Cookies are used to activate different functions. For example, you can stay logged in without entering a username and password. All registered users have the option to stay logged in. In this case, the username and the password are saved in a cookie on the computer.
                <br/>HOW DO I CHANGE SETTINGS OR PROFILE INFORMATION?
                <br/>   •	Your own data can be easily and quickly changed under "User profile".
                <br/>WHAT ARE ADMINISTRATORS?
                <br/>   •	Administrators have the highest control level on Playerscube. They have the right to perform certain actions such as assigning rights, suspending users, creating user groups, naming moderators and so on. In addition, they have the right of a moderator in every forum.
